# Summary

This project takes place in two parts: <br/>(1) a Kaggle competition where we have to predict the occurence of West Nile virus given certain features, and <br/>(2) a scenario where we make predictions that the City of Chicago can use when it decides where to spray pesticides.<br/>

For the predictive scenario, we have decided to predict the number of mosquitoes that will be caught in labelled traps as a way to assist in pesticide spray decisions.

## Problem Statement
> 1. How can we predict the presence of West Nile virus in an area?
> 2. How can we predict the number of mosquitoes in an area?

## Executive Summary
